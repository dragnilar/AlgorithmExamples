# Disorganized Dot Net Repo
This contains a smattering of various C# examples that I did not feel really fit into any particular themed repository.<br>
Most of these are just me playing around with something and/or providing an example for future reference to myself or someone else who is in need of an example.<br>
<br>

<br>
<h2>Currently This Junk Pile Includes</h2></br>
- Trees: A collection of playing around with tree data structures. Heavily based off of Scott Mitchel's MSDN article regarding Binary Search Trees.</br>

<br>

<h3>Other Notes:</h3>
- Initially this was intended to be strictly an algorithms repository, but after some thought I felt that was boring and too constrained.</br>
- Any code that is not intended to be an original work or is an adoption of another repo or solution floating around the web </br> has XML documentation indicating the source.
