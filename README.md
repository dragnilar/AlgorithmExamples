# AlgorithmExamples
This contains various C# algorithms that are commonly talked about on Stack Overflow, Reddit and other programming communities. <br>
This repo attempts to document and demonstrate them in one place. <br>
<br>
Most of the examples should have at minimum:

<ul>
<li>A class library</li>
<li>A console application that should utilize the library.</li>
<li>A desktop application that provides some sort of graphical demonstration.</li>
</ul>


<br>

<h2>Currently Implemented Algorithms/Examples</h1>
- Binary Search Tree

<br>

<h3>Other Notes:</h3>
- If time permits, an Avalonia version of the desktop application may be included for cross platform purposes.<br>
- The desktop applications may or may not use the library imeedietly, but the end goal is to utilize them. <br>
- None of this code is intended to be an original work, as gain, this is more or less just a storage place for examples.<br><br>
If you need a decent data structures / algorithms library, I strongly recommend you take a look at nGenerics, found  <a href="https://github.com/ngenerics/ngenerics"> here </a>.
